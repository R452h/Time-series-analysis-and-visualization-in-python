⏳ Time Series Analysis & Visualization in Python
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates time series analysis and visualization using Python.
It explores how stock price data changes over time and applies statistical techniques like trend detection, seasonality analysis, stationarity testing, differencing, and smoothing.

The goal is to help understand time-based data and prepare it for forecasting models.

🚀 Key Concepts Covered

Trend – Long-term direction of data.

Seasonality – Repeated patterns at regular intervals.

Moving Average – Smoothing short-term fluctuations.

Noise – Random irregular components.

Differencing – Making data stationary.

Stationarity – Mean, variance, and autocorrelation constant over time.

Autocorrelation – Similarity between time series and its lagged version.

Resampling – Changing data frequency (daily → monthly).

📂 Dataset

We use a stock dataset (stock_data.csv) with columns like:

Date → Time index

High → Daily high stock price

Volume, Open, Close, etc.

👉 Make sure the dataset has a Date column for time-based analysis.

⚙️ Installation & Requirements

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-series-analysis.git
cd time-series-analysis


Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib statsmodels

📊 Steps Implemented
1. Data Loading
df = pd.read_csv("stock_data.csv", parse_dates=True, index_col="Date")

2. Data Cleaning

Dropped unnecessary columns:

df.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0'], inplace=True, errors='ignore')

3. Visualization – High Stock Prices

Line plot of stock highs over time.

4. Resampling

Resampled to monthly data using .resample('M').mean().

5. Seasonality Detection

Autocorrelation plots with plot_acf().

6. Stationarity Test

ADF test (adfuller) to check stationarity.

7. Differencing

Created high_diff column to remove trends.

8. Moving Average

Smoothed data with a 120-day rolling mean.

9. Comparison

Plotted original vs differenced data and reran ADF test.

📈 Outputs

📉 Line plot of stock prices over time

📊 Resampled monthly averages

🔄 Autocorrelation plots to detect seasonality

🧪 ADF test results for stationarity

📉 Original vs Differenced series

📏 Moving average smoothing

🏆 Results

The raw stock data was non-stationary.

After differencing, the data became stationary (confirmed via ADF test).

Seasonal patterns were detected using autocorrelation.

Smoothed moving averages revealed long-term stock price trends.

📌 Applications

📊 Stock price analysis

🌡️ Sensor/IoT time series

📉 Forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM etc.)

📆 Trend & seasonality detection in business data

🔮 Future Work

Build ARIMA/SARIMA forecasting models

Apply exponential smoothing

Use machine learning (LSTMs) for predictions
