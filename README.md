**⏳ Time Series Analysis & Visualization in Python**

**📌 Overview**

This project demonstrates time series analysis and visualization using Python.
It explores how stock price data changes over time and applies statistical techniques like trend detection, seasonality analysis, stationarity testing, differencing, and smoothing.

The goal is to help understand time-based data and prepare it for forecasting models.

**🚀 Key Concepts Covered**

Trend – Long-term direction of data.

Seasonality – Repeated patterns at regular intervals.

Moving Average – Smoothing short-term fluctuations.

Noise – Random irregular components.

Differencing – Making data stationary.

Stationarity – Mean, variance, and autocorrelation constant over time.

Autocorrelation – Similarity between time series and its lagged version.

Resampling – Changing data frequency (daily → monthly).

**📂 Dataset**

We use a stock dataset (stock_data.csv) with columns like:

Date → Time index

High → Daily high stock price

Volume, Open, Close, etc.

👉 Make sure the dataset has a Date column for time-based analysis.

**⚙️Installation & Requirement**
  Install dependencies:

  pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib statsmodels

**📊Steps Implemented**
  1. Data Loading
  df = pd.read_csv("stock_data.csv", parse_dates=True, index_col="Date")

  2. Data Cleaning

  Dropped unnecessary columns:

  df.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0'], inplace=True, errors='ignore')

  3. Visualization – High Stock Prices

  Line plot of stock highs over time.

  4. Resampling

  Resampled to monthly data using .resample('M').mean().

  5. Seasonality Detection

  Autocorrelation plots with plot_acf().

  6. Stationarity Test

  ADF test (adfuller) to check stationarity.

  7. Differencing

  Created high_diff column to remove trends.

  8. Moving Average

  Smoothed data with a 120-day rolling mean.

  9. Comparison

  Plotted original vs differenced data and reran ADF test.

**📈 Outputs**

 📉 Line plot of stock prices over time

 📊 Resampled monthly averages

 🔄 Autocorrelation plots to detect seasonality

 🧪 ADF test results for stationarity

 📉 Original vs Differenced series

 📏 Moving average smoothing

**🏆 Results**

 The raw stock data was non-stationary.

 After differencing, the data became stationary (confirmed via ADF test).

 Seasonal patterns were detected using autocorrelation.

 Smoothed moving averages revealed long-term stock price trends.

**📌 Applications**

 📊 Stock price analysis

 🌡️ Sensor/IoT time series

 📉 Forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM etc.)

 📆 Trend & seasonality detection in business data
